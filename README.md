# Flatiron Rails Project - 35mm Film Rating App

My 35mm Film Rating App, is an application that allows a user to store a library of Film that they've used along with a rating they can give it to remember which films were good, and which were not so good. Along with this, they are able to search through other users ratings for film that they might want to try out in the future!

## Installation
Fork and clone this repo. 
Run ```bundle install``` in the terminal
Run ```rake:db migrate```
Run ```rails s``` and go to url: localhost:3000
You should now be able to run the app!
